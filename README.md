# World Happiness Report using Python
The World Happiness Report and is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. This analysis will cover global data from 2005-2023.

## Objective
In this project, I analyze which countries are the happiest and which factors have the highest impact on a countries happiness score. 
## Context
The World Happiness Report uses global data collected by the Gallup World Poll to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide. The global survey asks respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0.

The happiness score of each country is based on these six factors: 

- Economy (GDP per Capita) 
- Health (Life Expectancy) 
- Family (Social Support)
- Freedom (Life Choices)
- Generosity (Donations to Charity)
- Trust (Government Corruption)
## Key Questions
- Which countries are the happiest and unhappiest? 
- What are the highest and lowest happiness scores for countries? 
- Which variables have the strongest correlation for overall happiness? 
- How does the happiness score schange over the years for the United States? 
- How does the happiness score change over the years for the entire world? 
## Data Source
The project leverages open-source datasets from Kaggle. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

- **Scikit-learn**: to build and deploy machine learning models
## Stakeholders
The insights derived from this analysis will cater to:
- The general public
## Folders
- **01 Project Management**: Project brief
- **02 Data**: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data and visualization files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- **03 Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for analysis
- **04 Analysis**: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- **05 Sent to Client**: Final report
## Final Deliverable
For a comprehensive view of my findings, please refer to the [Final Project Presentation] as well as the [World Happiness Report zip folder](https://https://github.com/katiedallarosa/WorldHappinessReport-Python/blob/main/World%20Happiness%20Report%20KDallaRosa%202024.zip) containing all data sets, graphs, and reports.

This analysis is not only about uncovering current trends but also about predicting future world happiness.
